# Image Tiling & Reconstruction Using Pytorch

This algorithm is an implementation explicitly for Pytorch and was made for future projects. <br/>
It is an attempt to tile images into multiple smaller pieces in order to feed those images into a Convolutional Neural Network made for Pytorch.
<br/>

Requirements: Python>=3.7, torch, OpenCV, torchvision, pillow
## Installation
If you don't want to use a conda environment and want to use your base environment, so be it. Simply write to your command prompt
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
```commandline
> conda create -n ImageTiling python>=3.7
> conda activate ImageTiling
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
Come on you don't need to know this one
```commandline
> python tile_image.py
```
